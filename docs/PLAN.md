# PLAN — Architecture and Technical Design

**Project** `best2934-thief` (same engine as `best2934-cop`) · **Document version** 1.00 · **Code version** 1.0.0

Companion to [PRD.md](PRD.md). This document covers the C4 model, UML for the
non-obvious flows, the architectural decisions and their alternatives, and the
interface and data contracts.

---

## 1. C4 model

### 1.1 Level 1 — System context

```mermaid
graph TB
    team["Team best2934<br/>(operators)"]
    lecturer["Course lecturer<br/>rmisegal+uoh26finalgame@gmail.com"]
    opponent["Opposing team's agent<br/>(another university team)"]

    sys["<b>best2934 agent</b><br/>Autonomous cop / thief peer"]

    anthropic["Anthropic API<br/><i>optional</i>"]
    ollama["Local Ollama<br/><i>optional</i>"]
    gmail["Gmail API<br/>send-only scope"]
    tunnel["ngrok / Localtonet<br/>public tunnel"]

    team -->|"configures, launches"| sys
    sys <-->|"MCP over HTTP:<br/>commit / reveal / scent / audit"| opponent
    sys -->|"result JSON attachment"| gmail --> lecturer
    sys -.->|"one sentence per turn"| anthropic
    sys -.->|"one sentence per turn"| ollama
    sys --- tunnel
    opponent --- tunnel
```

There is deliberately **no** node in the middle. The tunnel forwards packets; it
arbitrates nothing.

### 1.2 Level 2 — Containers

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph proc["One agent process"]
        cli["CLI<br/><i>argparse</i>"]
        gui["Live view<br/><i>Tkinter / terminal</i>"]
        sdk["<b>P2PChaseSDK</b><br/>single entry point"]
        svc["Domain services<br/>match · verification<br/>negotiation · reporting"]
        dom["Domain core<br/>board · scent · belief<br/>crypto · brains"]
        rt["Runtime<br/>peer session · orchestrator<br/>watchdog"]
        mcpsrv["MCP server<br/><i>FastMCP, 11 tools</i>"]
        mcpcli["MCP client"]
        infra["Infrastructure<br/>Gatekeeper · Gmail · sysinfo"]
    end

    files[("config/ · artifacts/<br/>results/")]
    peer["Opponent peer"]

    cli --> sdk
    gui --> sdk
    sdk --> svc --> dom
    svc --> rt --> dom
    svc --> infra
    rt --> mcpcli --> peer
    peer --> mcpsrv --> rt
    svc --> files
```

**The layering rule.** Nothing above the SDK contains logic, and nothing below it
knows a presentation layer exists. A CLI command that decided anything could not
be reused by the GUI and could not be tested without argparse.

### 1.3 Level 3 — Components (runtime and domain)

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph runtime
        session["PeerSession<br/><i>our private world</i>"]
        runner["PeerRunner<br/><i>the turn loop</i>"]
        wd["Watchdog + TurnDeadline"]
        side["Side / judge_claim"]
    end

    subgraph domain
        board["Board<br/>geometry, barriers, paths"]
        scent["ScentMap<br/>kernel, decay, centroid"]
        belief["BeliefMap<br/>posterior + trust"]
        crypto["commit / audit_records"]
        brain["CopBrain / ThiefBrain"]
        trail["trail_reading"]
    end

    subgraph strategy
        decoder["hint_decoder"]
        talk["TalkEngine + 4 providers"]
    end

    runner --> session
    runner --> wd
    session --> brain --> belief
    session --> crypto
    session --> side
    side --> decoder
    side --> belief
    belief --> board
    belief --> scent
    scent --> trail --> belief
    session --> talk
```

### 1.4 Level 4 — Code: one turn, one peer

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    participant B as Brain
    participant S as PeerSession
    participant T as TalkEngine
    participant N as Network
    participant BM as BeliefMap

    S->>B: decide(state)
    B-->>S: Decision(move, intent, claimed_heading)
    S->>T: compose(spoken_heading)
    T-->>S: hint (≤15 words)
    S->>S: commit(payload ‖ nonce)
    S->>N: commit_step(hash)
    N-->>S: their commit_step(hash)
    S->>N: reveal_step(move, hint)
    N-->>S: their reveal_step(move, hint)
    S->>BM: predict()  %% diffuse by one opponent turn
    S->>S: record_claim(hint)
    S->>N: sample_scent(top-12 believed cells)
    N-->>S: intensities
    S->>BM: update_from_scent()
    S->>BM: judge_claim() → score_claim + update_from_hint
```

Step 12 is the one worth pausing on: the claim is *recorded* when the hint
arrives but *judged* only after the trail has been sampled, because the trail is
the only thing a claim can be checked against and it does not exist yet at
step 8.

---

## 2. UML

### 2.1 Turn state machine (rules 4, 5)

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> IDLE
    IDLE --> NEGOTIATING
    NEGOTIATING --> DECLARED
    DECLARED --> AWAIT_COMMIT
    AWAIT_COMMIT --> AWAIT_ACK
    AWAIT_ACK --> AWAIT_REVEAL
    AWAIT_REVEAL --> APPLIED
    APPLIED --> AWAIT_COMMIT: next step
    APPLIED --> FINALISING: sub-game over
    FINALISING --> AUDITED
    AUDITED --> DONE
    DONE --> [*]

    NEGOTIATING --> ABORTED: fingerprint mismatch
    AWAIT_COMMIT --> ABORTED: deadline / watchdog
    AWAIT_ACK --> ABORTED: deadline / watchdog
    AWAIT_REVEAL --> ABORTED: deadline / watchdog
    AUDITED --> ABORTED: integrity failure
    ABORTED --> [*]: technical loss, score 0
```

Any transition not drawn is rejected. A permissive protocol is how distributed
systems deadlock.

### 2.2 Class model — belief and evidence

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class OwnState {
        +role: str
        +position: Coord
        +belief: BeliefMap
        +my_scent: ScentMap
        +opponent_scent: ScentMap
        +trail_centre: tuple
        +trail_drift: str
        +pending_claim: str
        +apply_own_move()
        +apply_opponent_move()
        +sample_opponent_scent()
    }
    class BeliefMap {
        +grid: dict~Coord,float~
        +trust: float
        +hints_seen: int
        +hints_contradicted: int
        +predict()
        +update_from_scent()
        +update_from_hint(heading)
        +score_claim(claimed, observed) bool
    }
    class ScentMap {
        +grid: dict~Coord,float~
        +kernel
        +decay: float
        +emit(cell)
        +decay_all()
        +centroid() tuple
    }
    class Board {
        +barriers: set
        +legal_moves()
        +shortest_path_length()
        +reachable_area()
    }
    OwnState *-- BeliefMap
    OwnState *-- ScentMap
    OwnState *-- Board
    BeliefMap --> Board
    BeliefMap ..> ScentMap : reads
```

Note what is **not** on `OwnState`: there is no `opponent_position`. The
epistemic constraint is enforced by the absence of the attribute, not by
discipline.

### 2.3 Deployment

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph hostA["Machine A — team best2934"]
        pa["p2pchase play --role police<br/>serves + calls · 127.0.0.1:9901"]
        ta["ngrok tunnel"]
        pa --- ta
    end
    subgraph hostB["Machine B — opposing team"]
        pb["their agent<br/>127.0.0.1:9902"]
        tb["their tunnel"]
        pb --- tb
    end
    ta <-->|"public HTTPS<br/>MCP"| tb
```

Rule 1 requires two separate processes and rule 2 forbids shared memory between
them; the server binds a real socket even when both peers sit on one laptop. Each
box is one whole peer — it serves and calls over a single session (ADR-015) — so
the two processes are the two *teams'*. The in-process `LoopbackClient` exists
only for tests; `tools/rehearsal.py` reproduces this diagram on one machine.

## 3. Architecture Decision Records

### ADR-001 · Peer-to-peer MCP, not client/server

**Status** Accepted.
**Context** Two agents must exchange moves without a referee.
**Decision** Each agent runs a FastMCP server *and* a client. The protocol is
symmetric: no initiator, no responder.
**Alternatives** (a) One agent hosts and the other connects — rejected, the host
sequences the game and is therefore a de-facto referee. (b) A shared message
broker — rejected, it is a central component by another name.
**Trade-off** Twice the moving parts per process, and the symmetric loop needs
care to avoid deadlock. Both peers push and wait concurrently, which is exercised
directly in `tests/integration/test_networked_sub_game.py` via `asyncio.gather`.

### ADR-002 · SHA-256 commit-reveal with nonces withheld until the end

**Status** Accepted.
**Context** With no referee, a peer could choose its move after seeing the
opponent's.
**Decision** Seal `SHA-256(canonical_json(payload) ‖ nonce)` before acting;
disclose payload at reveal and nonce only at the end of the sub-game (rule 18).
**Alternatives** (a) Reveal the nonce each step — rejected, it leaks the
commitment structure earlier than needed for no gain. (b) Digital signatures —
rejected, they authenticate the *author*, not the *timing*, which is the
property at issue here.
**Trade-off** Verification is deferred to the end. Accepted: the whole log is
checked at once, and a mismatch is a technical loss either way.

### ADR-003 · The LLM never decides a move

**Status** Accepted (rule 25).
**Context** A language model could plausibly pick moves.
**Decision** Movement is deterministic Python. The LLM composes only the
one-sentence hint.
**Alternatives** LLM-chosen moves — rejected: hallucinated illegal moves are a
technical loss, latency threatens the 30 s deadline, and a replayed log stops
being explicable.
**Trade-off** The rhetorical layer is decorative unless the *receiving* side
decodes it — which is why ADR-007 exists.

### ADR-004 · Belief transport, not re-weighting, for a directional claim

**Status** Accepted (supersedes the original design).
**Context** A hint claims a heading. The first implementation built the set of
cells "consistent with north" and boosted them.
**Decision** Transport a fraction `trust` of every cell's mass one step in the
claimed direction; leave `1 − trust` in place.
**Rationale** Once belief has diffused, almost every cell has a northern
neighbour, so the claimed set covered the board and the re-weighting cancelled
out — a mechanism that provably did nothing. A directional claim is evidence
about how the cloud *moved*, and transport is the update it licenses.
**Trade-off** Mass at a wall cannot move and stays put, which slightly biases
belief toward edges. Accepted: the alternative is belief evaporating off-board.

### ADR-005 · Cross-examine the sentence, not the revealed move

**Status** Accepted (bug fix, commit `96229b2`).
**Context** Lie detection scored the opponent's revealed move.
**Decision** Decode and score the *hint*.
**Rationale** The move is sealed in the commitment and is therefore always
truthful; cross-examining it could only ever confirm honesty. Measured: trust sat
pinned at its 0.9 ceiling in every match and a compulsive liar was
indistinguishable from an honest opponent.
**Result** Liar collapses to the 0.020 floor with 97% of its claims contradicted;
honest opponent settles at 0.724. Measured over 30 seeds — `results/trust.json`.

### ADR-006 · Read the opponent's heading from scent-centroid drift

**Status** Accepted.
**Context** A claim needs something physical to be checked against.
**Decision** Compare the sub-cell centroid of the opponent's trail between
samples; the dominant axis of the drift is the observed heading.
**Alternatives measured, not assumed** — (a) Half-plane scent mass relative to
the trail peak: agreed with the true heading on roughly half of turns, and was
outvoted by the wrong direction on several. (b) Peak-cell displacement: the peak
moves in integer jumps, so it reads as "no movement" then "impossible movement".
(c) Centroid drift: agreed on ~80% of turns where the opponent actually moved
(69.3% of all claims once stationary turns are counted too).
**Trade-off** Measured over 30 seeds, a perfectly honest opponent still has
30.7% of its claims contradicted, so trust settles at 0.724 rather than at the
0.90 ceiling. That is honest about the measurement's noise, and the separation
from a liar (0.020, with 97% of claims contradicted) is still decisive.

### ADR-007 · Deception is rationed, not sprayed

**Status** Accepted.
**Context** How often should the thief lie?
**Decision** Lie only when the believed cop position is within `bluff_range`, and
then only every `bluff_period` turns.
**Rationale** The opponent runs the same cross-check we do. A thief that lies
every turn trains the cop to ignore it, and a hint nobody believes is worth
nothing when one is finally needed. Confirmed by the trust measurements: the
compulsive liar earns 0.020 trust, the rationed liar 0.679, against 0.724 for a
thief that never lies at all. The sweep adds the other half of the argument:
lying every turn raises the thief's own chance of being captured from 0.133 to
0.333, so over-lying is not merely wasteful, it is actively losing.

### ADR-008 · The Gatekeeper queues rather than rejects

**Status** Accepted (revised).
**Context** An autonomous agent that e-mails in a loop gets the account
suspended.
**Decision** `DosDetector → QuotaManager → TokenBucket → OverflowQueue`. Excess
work waits with backpressure.
**Alternatives** Rejecting over-limit calls — rejected: the caller then either
drops the report (data loss) or retries in a hot loop (the original problem).
**Trade-off** A caller can block. Bounded by queue depth, and a full queue raises
`QueueFullError` rather than growing without limit.

### ADR-009 · The revealed move does not collapse belief

**Status** Accepted, with a noted tension in the source material.
**Context** The protocol discloses the move each step (booklet §5.3.2), and start
positions are agreed. Applying revealed directions to a known start would make
the opponent's position exactly known, and the belief map pointless.
**Decision** `apply_opponent_move` advances the diffusion model and records
barriers; it does not shift belief by the revealed direction.
**Rationale** Booklet §6.4 is explicit that neither side sees the other's true
position and that the belief map is `P(opponent = s | hints)`. Where the two
readings conflict, the chapter defining the mechanism governs. A move name only
locates someone if you already knew where they were.
**Trade-off** We discard information the wire technically carries. Accepted: the
alternative deletes the graded mechanism.

### ADR-010 · JSON over TOML for configuration

**Status** Accepted.
**Context** Rule 11 requires both peers to hold a byte-identical agreed config
and to hash it.
**Decision** JSON, hashed via canonical serialisation.
**Rationale** JSON has one canonical form across languages; TOML does not, so two
peers writing "the same" config could hash differently and refuse to play.

### ADR-011 · Two clocks, one measuring progress

**Status** Accepted.
**Context** Rule 6 makes an unfinished sub-game a technical loss for *both*
teams.
**Decision** `TurnDeadline` (30 s, per message) and `Watchdog` (60 s, fed only by
`beat()` at the end of a completed step).
**Rationale** A single per-message timeout cannot catch an opponent that answers
every message promptly while never advancing the game. The watchdog measures
progress, so livelock trips it.

### ADR-012 · `barrier_engage_range` set to 1, chosen by max-min over five thieves

**Status** Accepted. Supersedes the hand-picked default of 4.
**Context** The cop may drop a barrier instead of moving. The original value of 4
was reasoned about, not measured: engage early, herd the thief. A one-at-a-time
sweep (`tools/sweep.py`, 2400 sub-games, raw data in `results/sweep.json`)
measured the opposite.

| `barrier_engage_range` | Capture rate ± SE |
|---|---|
| 1 | **0.850 ± 0.046** |
| 2 | 0.783 ± 0.053 |
| 4 | 0.133 ± 0.044 |

**Decision** Set it to 1.
**Rationale** A barrier costs the cop its move for that turn. Engaging from four
cells away means standing still while the thief walks away — the cop pays the
turn and buys nothing, because the thief is nowhere near the wall. At range 1 the
barrier is placed where the thief must actually cross it.

**Why max-min, not the sweep mean.** A sweep tunes against *one* opponent, so its
winner is a candidate, not a conclusion. The value was re-measured
(`tools/robustness.py`, `results/robustness.json`) against five structurally
different thieves — shipped, area-obsessed, distance-only, always-endgame,
never-bluffs — at 60 seeds each, and selected on the **worst** case rather than
the average:

| Level | Mean over thieves | Worst case |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | 0.737 | **0.433** |
| 2 | 0.740 | 0.367 |
| 4 | 0.120 | 0.050 |

Level 2 has a marginally better mean and a clearly worse floor. In a league where
the opponent is unknown and unrepeatable, the floor is the number that matters.

**Alternatives rejected** Keeping 4 as a "principled" default (it loses 6 games
in 7); picking by sweep mean alone (overfits to our own thief); making it
adaptive by observed opponent style (no sample size within a 35-step sub-game to
estimate the style before the decision must be made).

**Honest caveat** All five test thieves are ours, so they share our idea of what
a thief does. The measurement bounds overfitting to a single policy; it cannot
rule out overfitting to a single *authorship*. `barrier_engage_range` is TUNABLE
under Appendix F and can be changed between matches without touching code.

### ADR-013 · Capture is claimed and answered, not computed

**Status** Accepted. Closes a defect found while writing [COMPLIANCE.md](COMPLIANCE.md).
**Context** The local harness ends a sub-game by comparing both positions --
something it can do because it holds both. No peer can. The networked runner
checked only `survival_reached()`, so a cop standing on the thief in a real
league match would have played on to the move ceiling and scored the sub-game
as the thief's survival. Every test passed, because every test that could see
it was a local one.
**Decision** The cop attaches a `capture_claim` to every reveal, naming the cell
it is about to occupy -- or the cell it just sealed a barrier on (rule 46). The
thief answers truthfully from its own cell in the same round trip. Either
answer ends the sub-game.
**Rationale** The cop can only speak honestly about its own position, which is
the one thing it actually knows; the thief is the only party that can check the
claim. Both the claim and the answer are sealed in the commit chain, so a false
denial is provable at the audit and forfeits the game (rule 22) -- the mechanism
is honest because lying is strictly worse, not because we trust anyone.
**Alternatives rejected** Deriving the opponent's position from revealed moves
and the agreed start (contradicts ADR-009 and deletes the belief map);
exchanging positions every turn (hands the thief the pursuer's location for
free); detecting capture only at the final audit (the sub-game would run past
its own ending).
**Trade-off** The thief learns where the cop is, every turn. That is the
asymmetry the booklet intends: the pursued may see the pursuer, and the claim
is what makes rules 21 and 22 mean anything.

### ADR-014 · The coordinate ban is enforced on the way out, not requested

**Status** Accepted.
**Context** Rule 27 forbids a numeric position protocol; rule 26 requires free
natural language. The system prompt asked the model for both. A prompt is a
request, and a request is not a guarantee: a model returning "heading to 3,4"
would breach a rule whose sanction is losing the game's character.
**Decision** `strip_positions` deletes digit-bearing tokens and square-naming
vocabulary from every hint, for every provider including our own template bank,
immediately before `clamp_words`.
**Rationale** A guard that trusts some of its inputs is a guard that stops being
run. Deleting is preferred to refusing because a hint is optional: degrading to
a shorter sentence costs nothing, while raising here would turn a chatty model
into a technical loss.
**Trade-off** A legitimate sentence containing a number ("three steps behind
you") loses a word. Acceptable -- the taunt is not scored and the rule is.

---

### ADR-015 · One process is the whole peer: it serves and plays together

**Status** Accepted. Supersedes the two-terminal `serve` + `play` flow.
**Context** The README told an operator to run `serve` in one terminal and
`play` in another. Two processes, two `PeerSession` objects, no shared memory
between them -- so the opponent's commitments arrived in the *server's* session
while the turn loop waited on the *client's*. The first rehearsal over real
sockets sat at step 1 until the 30-second deadline and booked a technical loss
for both teams. Every test passed, because a `LoopbackClient` hands the runner
and the handlers the same session by construction.
**Decision** `play` starts the FastMCP server itself, in the same event loop and
over the same session, and waits (bounded) for the opponent's endpoint to answer
before move one. `serve` survives as the server half alone, for reachability
checks.
**Rationale** Rule 1 separates the *cop and the thief*, not a team's own halves;
one process per team is two per match. One event loop rather than a thread each
makes the interleaving of inbound handler and outbound loop cooperative, so the
order is the protocol's rather than the scheduler's.
**Trade-off** The peer no longer starts before it has somewhere to play. The
bounded wait covers the real case -- two teams never press enter together.

### ADR-016 · A tool signature is a wire contract, and is tested as one

**Status** Accepted.
**Context** FastMCP builds each tool's schema from its Python signature and
refuses any argument the signature does not name. `commit_step`, `reveal_step`
and `final_reveal` all omitted keys that `contracts.py` had been putting on the
wire for weeks -- including `capture_claim`, the whole of rule 21. Over a
loopback client the payload dict is passed straight through, so the suite was
structurally incapable of noticing. A real match would have been refused at
move one.
**Decision** Every key a payload builder emits appears in the corresponding tool
signature, including ones the handler ignores. `tests/integration/
test_live_transport.py` calls the real FastMCP tool layer with the real payload
builders and pins the refusal behaviour so the gap cannot reopen.
**Rationale** Being permissive about what we accept is also the right posture
towards an opponent's independent implementation; being strict about what we
send is not something we can check by reading.
**Trade-off** Signatures carry fields that look like noise. The docstring says
why, and the alternative is a technical loss nobody can debug during a match.

### ADR-017 · A peer that stops first declares how the sub-game ended

**Status** Accepted.
**Context** Rule 47 captures a thief with no legal move -- and only the thief
can see that. It stopped playing and exited; the cop, having won, waited out its
deadline for a commitment that was never coming and recorded a technical loss.
Rule 6 charges *both* teams for that.
**Decision** `final_reveal` carries an `outcome`. Receiving it marks the sub-game
finished on our side too, and a peer waiting for a message stops waiting and
adopts the declared ending instead of aborting. A fault raised after that
announcement is likewise treated as the expected consequence of an opponent that
has already gone.
**Rationale** The only ending a peer can declare unilaterally is one against
itself, and the disclosed chain arrives in the same message, so the claim is
checkable move by move rather than taken on trust.
**Trade-off** One more field to agree with an opponent. It defaults to empty and
an opponent that never sets it behaves exactly as before.

### ADR-018 · The agreement digest covers only what both teams can derive

**Status** Accepted.
**Context** `mutual_agreement.sha256` hashed the whole result summary --
including `started_at` (microseconds apart), `tokens` and `github_commit` (each
team's own), `audit` (a statement *about* the other side) and `game_uid` (minted
locally, never negotiated). Two rehearsal peers that agreed on every fact of the
match produced different digests. Rule 35 answers a contradiction by voiding the
match and scoring both teams zero.
**Decision** `agreed_summary` narrows the digest to the facts both peers derive
from the same protocol messages: game id, groups, and per sub-game the roles,
result, winner, tie flag and score, plus the series totals that follow from
them. Everything private is still *reported*, just not hashed.
**Rationale** A certificate of agreement may only cover things that can be
agreed. Hashing private fields does not make the report stricter, it makes it
meaningless -- it would have failed on every honest match and never once on a
dishonest one.
**Trade-off** Two teams that disagree only about a timestamp now hash the same.
That is the intended reading of rule 35: the ending is the thing.

---

### ADR-019 · We speak the opponent's tool surface, they do not speak ours

**Status** Accepted.
**Context** gal-roy1 publish six tools (`hello`, `propose_config`,
`declare_step0`, `submit_turn`, `final_audit`, `agree_result`), each taking a
single `payload` object. Ours name every field in the signature. Three names
collide with different calling conventions; three do not exist on our side at
all. Two teams that agree on every rule in the book still lose at move one
(rule 6).
**Decision** `mcp/interop.py` adapts their vocabulary to ours, and
`mcp/interop_server.py` binds the three non-colliding names. For the three that
collide, one endpoint answers both dialects by widening the signature —
`agree_result(sha256="", expected="", payload=None)` — rather than by
registering a second tool.
**Rationale** Their shape matches the lecturer's reference server, so it is what
a third team is likeliest to speak too; they dial out and drive, which makes our
side mostly a matter of answering correctly; and `PeerHandlers` already took a
single dict per call, so the whole mismatch lived in the server binding.
**Trade-off** We carry the translation cost for both teams. Cheaper than a
technical loss, and it means our native surface never has to change.
**Note** The adapter was written, unit-tested and *never bound to the server*.
Every test passed because they called the adapter directly. See ADR-016 — the
same lesson, learned twice.

---

### ADR-020 · `propose_config` answers a proposal; two digests, separately named

**Status** Accepted.
**Context** Their preflight sends `{"config": {...}}`. We read it as our own
older `{"handshake": {...}}` shape, found every field absent, and reported three
mismatches against empty strings — refusing a peer who had proposed a perfectly
legal config. Underneath sat a second fault: our published `config_sha256`
covers `AGREED_SECTIONS`, a *subset*; theirs covers the whole file. Those two
can never be equal, and their inequality says nothing about either config.
**Decision** Branch on the shape of what arrived. For a proposal, hash their
object under our encoding and return `config_sha256` (their object, our
canonicaliser), `our_config_sha256` (our whole config), and
`our_agreed_terms_sha256` (the subset) — each under its own name, plus
`illegal_terms` and a recursive `differing_terms`.
**Rationale** A matching digest proves the two *canonicalisations* agree, which
is the thing most likely to break (their CONNECT.md §3, and HW6). It does not
prove their defaults equal ours; conflating the two made rule 11 unsatisfiable
rather than satisfied. Two questions, two fields.
**Trade-off** Three digests in one reply is more surface to explain. Every one
of them answers a different question, and the failure we shipped was caused by
having one field answer two.

### ADR-021 · The mid-game reveal discloses the hint, the barrier, and nothing else

**Status** Accepted. Agreed with gal-roy1 as interop item I-5.
**Context** The reveal disclosed the entire sealed payload. Three fields should
never have been in it. `move` gives our heading away. `intent` is the truth/lie
flag, which annotates each sentence with whether to believe it — the deception
layer, handed over for free. Worst is `state`:
`SHA256({step, role, position, board})`, where every field but `position` is
public, leaving 49 candidates on a 7×7 board. We brute-forced our own disclosed
digest and recovered the exact cell in 49 hashes, every step, for both roles.
The binding that stops a commitment being replayed in another context
(book ch5.3.1) was also a plaintext position broadcast.
**Decision** `CommitRecord.revealed_view()` emits `MID_GAME_FIELDS` only —
`step`, `role`, `sub_game`, `hint`, `barrier`. The full payload is disclosed at
the final audit, where the nonce makes it verifiable and the match is decided.
We stopped *sending* `move` and `intent`; we still *accept* both, since a peer
who has not made this change will keep sending them.
**Rationale** The nonce is withheld until the audit (rule 18), so nothing
disclosed mid-game can be checked when it arrives. The mid-game reveal buys no
integrity whatsoever; it only gives information away. Barriers stay because
rule 15 requires the cop to declare each placement openly — common knowledge by
design, not a leak.
**Trade-off** None measurable. `apply_opponent_move` never read `move` — it only
ever consumed the barrier and counted the step — so we were disclosing ours
every turn and discarding theirs unread.
**Consequence** The capture claim is now the only position we disclose in the
clear, and a cop that claims on every step broadcasts its exact track. That was
free while the move sat beside it; it is a real disclosure now. Raised with
gal-roy1 rather than changed unilaterally, because it alters when messages
appear on the wire.
**Note** All 461 in-process tests passed with the mandatory `move: str` still in
the `reveal_step` signature; two real peers could not complete one step. Caught
by the rehearsal gate, which is the third time a tool signature has been the
wire contract (ADR-016, ADR-019).

## 4. Interface contracts

### 4.1 MCP tools (eleven, symmetric)

| Tool | Direction | Payload | Response |
|---|---|---|---|
| `hello` | both | — | `{ok, handshake, tools}` |
| `negotiate` | both | `{handshake}` | `{ok, agreed, mismatches}` |
| `declare_step0` | both | signed declaration | `{ok}` |
| `commit_step` | both | `{game_id, sub_game_number, step, commit, sender_group, sender_role}` | `{ok}` |
| `acknowledge_step` | both | `{game_id, sub_game_number, step}` | `{ok, held}` |
| `reveal_step` | both | `{…, move, hint, barrier?, capture_claim?}` | `{ok, caught}` |
| `sample_scent` | both | `{…, cells: [[r,c],…]}` | `{ok, samples: {"r,c": φ}}` |
| `final_reveal` | both | `{game_id, sub_game_number, sender_group, records, outcome}` | `{ok, records, group}` |
| `audit_result` | both | `{records}` | `{ok, passed, failed_steps}` |
| `agree_result` | both | `{sha256, expected}` | `{ok, agreed}` |
| `abort` | both | `{reason}` | `{ok}` |

**Refusals are data, not exceptions.** Every handler answers
`{"ok": false, "reason": …}` rather than raising. An exception crossing MCP
reaches the opponent as an opaque transport failure indistinguishable from a
crash, and rule 6 charges both teams for a stall.

### 4.2 SDK surface

```python
sdk = P2PChaseSDK.for_role("police")
sdk.describe()                      # identity, fingerprints, hardware
sdk.handshake()                     # what an opponent must match
sdk.agree_with(theirs)              # -> Agreement
sdk.run_series(opponent, sub_games) # -> SeriesResult, writes all artifacts
sdk.verify_log(path)                # -> AuditVerdict
sdk.audit_opponent(paths)           # -> (all_passed, verdicts)   rule 36
sdk.replay_text(path)               # human-readable replay
sdk.send_report(result, dry_run)    # -> DeliveryReceipt, via the Gatekeeper
sdk.gate_status()                   # queue health
```

### 4.3 Configuration split

| File | Shared? | Contents |
|---|---|---|
| `config/<role>/game.json` | **Yes** — byte-identical, hashed (rule 11) | Agreed physics: board, movement, scoring, pheromones, timeouts |
| `config/<role>/setup.json` | No — private | Port, opponent URL, group identity, strategy weights, talk provider, LLM settings |
| `config/rate_limits.json` | No | Gatekeeper limits per service |

The decision test is one question: *must the opponent agree to this value, or
rely on it?* If yes it is shared; if no it stays private. Precedence is
one-directional — a private file can never weaken a signed term.

## 5. Data schemas

All four artifacts carry `_schema`, `schema_version`, `game_id` and `game_uid`.

### 5.1 Commit record (the unit of integrity)

```json
{
  "payload": {
    "step": 7, "role": "thief", "sub_game_number": 1,
    "move": "N", "hint": "Moving north past Harlem. Still breathing.",
    "intent": "truth", "barrier": null,
    "state_digest": "<sha256 of the board snapshot>"
  },
  "nonce": "<128-bit hex, disclosed only at final reveal>",
  "commit": "<sha256(canonical_json(payload) ‖ nonce)>"
}
```

`state_digest` binds the commitment to the board it was made on, so an old
commitment cannot be replayed in a new context.

### 5.2 Artifact set per game

| File | One per | Contains |
|---|---|---|
| `declaration_<game_id>.json` | game | Both identities, hardware, repos, MCP URLs, budget |
| `config_<game_id>_g<NN>.json` | sub-game | The agreed terms actually played, hashed |
| `log_<game_id>_g<NN>.json` | sub-game | Step 0 declaration + every commit record + audit verdict |
| `result_<game_id>.json` | game | Per-sub-game outcomes, tally, tokens, mutual agreement digest |
