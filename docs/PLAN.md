# PLAN — Architecture and Technical Design

**Project** `best2934-thief` (same engine as `best2934-cop`) · **Document version** 1.00 · **Code version** 1.0.0

Companion to [PRD.md](PRD.md). This document covers the C4 model, UML for the
non-obvious flows, the architectural decisions and their alternatives, and the
interface and data contracts.

---

## 1. C4 model

### 1.1 Level 1 — System context

```mermaid
graph TB
    team["Team best2934<br/>(operators)"]
    lecturer["Course lecturer<br/>rmisegal+uoh26finalgame@gmail.com"]
    opponent["Opposing team's agent<br/>(another university team)"]

    sys["<b>best2934 agent</b><br/>Autonomous cop / thief peer"]

    anthropic["Anthropic API<br/><i>optional</i>"]
    ollama["Local Ollama<br/><i>optional</i>"]
    gmail["Gmail API<br/>send-only scope"]
    tunnel["ngrok / Localtonet<br/>public tunnel"]

    team -->|"configures, launches"| sys
    sys <-->|"MCP over HTTP:<br/>commit / reveal / scent / audit"| opponent
    sys -->|"result JSON attachment"| gmail --> lecturer
    sys -.->|"one sentence per turn"| anthropic
    sys -.->|"one sentence per turn"| ollama
    sys --- tunnel
    opponent --- tunnel
```

There is deliberately **no** node in the middle. The tunnel forwards packets; it
arbitrates nothing.

### 1.2 Level 2 — Containers

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph proc["One agent process"]
        cli["CLI<br/><i>argparse</i>"]
        gui["Live view<br/><i>Tkinter / terminal</i>"]
        sdk["<b>P2PChaseSDK</b><br/>single entry point"]
        svc["Domain services<br/>match · verification<br/>negotiation · reporting"]
        dom["Domain core<br/>board · scent · belief<br/>crypto · brains"]
        rt["Runtime<br/>peer session · orchestrator<br/>watchdog"]
        mcpsrv["MCP server<br/><i>FastMCP, 11 tools</i>"]
        mcpcli["MCP client"]
        infra["Infrastructure<br/>Gatekeeper · Gmail · sysinfo"]
    end

    files[("config/ · artifacts/<br/>results/")]
    peer["Opponent peer"]

    cli --> sdk
    gui --> sdk
    sdk --> svc --> dom
    svc --> rt --> dom
    svc --> infra
    rt --> mcpcli --> peer
    peer --> mcpsrv --> rt
    svc --> files
```

**The layering rule.** Nothing above the SDK contains logic, and nothing below it
knows a presentation layer exists. A CLI command that decided anything could not
be reused by the GUI and could not be tested without argparse.

### 1.3 Level 3 — Components (runtime and domain)

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph runtime
        session["PeerSession<br/><i>our private world</i>"]
        runner["PeerRunner<br/><i>the turn loop</i>"]
        wd["Watchdog + TurnDeadline"]
        side["Side / judge_claim"]
    end

    subgraph domain
        board["Board<br/>geometry, barriers, paths"]
        scent["ScentMap<br/>kernel, decay, centroid"]
        belief["BeliefMap<br/>posterior + trust"]
        crypto["commit / audit_records"]
        brain["CopBrain / ThiefBrain"]
        trail["trail_reading"]
    end

    subgraph strategy
        decoder["hint_decoder"]
        talk["TalkEngine + 4 providers"]
    end

    runner --> session
    runner --> wd
    session --> brain --> belief
    session --> crypto
    session --> side
    side --> decoder
    side --> belief
    belief --> board
    belief --> scent
    scent --> trail --> belief
    session --> talk
```

### 1.4 Level 4 — Code: one turn, one peer

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    participant B as Brain
    participant S as PeerSession
    participant T as TalkEngine
    participant N as Network
    participant BM as BeliefMap

    S->>B: decide(state)
    B-->>S: Decision(move, intent, claimed_heading)
    S->>T: compose(spoken_heading)
    T-->>S: hint (≤15 words)
    S->>S: commit(payload ‖ nonce)
    S->>N: commit_step(hash)
    N-->>S: their commit_step(hash)
    S->>N: reveal_step(move, hint)
    N-->>S: their reveal_step(move, hint)
    S->>BM: predict()  %% diffuse by one opponent turn
    S->>S: record_claim(hint)
    S->>N: sample_scent(top-12 believed cells)
    N-->>S: intensities
    S->>BM: update_from_scent()
    S->>BM: judge_claim() → score_claim + update_from_hint
```

Step 12 is the one worth pausing on: the claim is *recorded* when the hint
arrives but *judged* only after the trail has been sampled, because the trail is
the only thing a claim can be checked against and it does not exist yet at
step 8.

---

## 2. UML

### 2.1 Turn state machine (rules 4, 5)

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> IDLE
    IDLE --> NEGOTIATING
    NEGOTIATING --> DECLARED
    DECLARED --> AWAIT_COMMIT
    AWAIT_COMMIT --> AWAIT_ACK
    AWAIT_ACK --> AWAIT_REVEAL
    AWAIT_REVEAL --> APPLIED
    APPLIED --> AWAIT_COMMIT: next step
    APPLIED --> FINALISING: sub-game over
    FINALISING --> AUDITED
    AUDITED --> DONE
    DONE --> [*]

    NEGOTIATING --> ABORTED: fingerprint mismatch
    AWAIT_COMMIT --> ABORTED: deadline / watchdog
    AWAIT_ACK --> ABORTED: deadline / watchdog
    AWAIT_REVEAL --> ABORTED: deadline / watchdog
    AUDITED --> ABORTED: integrity failure
    ABORTED --> [*]: technical loss, score 0
```

Any transition not drawn is rejected. A permissive protocol is how distributed
systems deadlock.

### 2.2 Class model — belief and evidence

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class OwnState {
        +role: str
        +position: Coord
        +belief: BeliefMap
        +my_scent: ScentMap
        +opponent_scent: ScentMap
        +trail_centre: tuple
        +trail_drift: str
        +pending_claim: str
        +apply_own_move()
        +apply_opponent_move()
        +sample_opponent_scent()
    }
    class BeliefMap {
        +grid: dict~Coord,float~
        +trust: float
        +hints_seen: int
        +hints_contradicted: int
        +predict()
        +update_from_scent()
        +update_from_hint(heading)
        +score_claim(claimed, observed) bool
    }
    class ScentMap {
        +grid: dict~Coord,float~
        +kernel
        +decay: float
        +emit(cell)
        +decay_all()
        +centroid() tuple
    }
    class Board {
        +barriers: set
        +legal_moves()
        +shortest_path_length()
        +reachable_area()
    }
    OwnState *-- BeliefMap
    OwnState *-- ScentMap
    OwnState *-- Board
    BeliefMap --> Board
    BeliefMap ..> ScentMap : reads
```

Note what is **not** on `OwnState`: there is no `opponent_position`. The
epistemic constraint is enforced by the absence of the attribute, not by
discipline.

### 2.3 Deployment

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph hostA["Machine A — team best2934"]
        pa["p2pchase play --role police<br/>serves + calls · 127.0.0.1:9901"]
        ta["ngrok tunnel"]
        pa --- ta
    end
    subgraph hostB["Machine B — opposing team"]
        pb["their agent<br/>127.0.0.1:9902"]
        tb["their tunnel"]
        pb --- tb
    end
    ta <-->|"public HTTPS<br/>MCP"| tb
```

Rule 1 requires two separate processes and rule 2 forbids shared memory between
them; the server binds a real socket even when both peers sit on one laptop. Each
box is one whole peer — it serves and calls over a single session (ADR-015) — so
the two processes are the two *teams'*. The in-process `LoopbackClient` exists
only for tests; `tools/rehearsal.py` reproduces this diagram on one machine.

## 3. Architecture Decision Records

### ADR-001 · Peer-to-peer MCP, not client/server

**Status** Accepted.
**Context** Two agents must exchange moves without a referee.
**Decision** Each agent runs a FastMCP server *and* a client. The protocol is
symmetric: no initiator, no responder.
**Alternatives** (a) One agent hosts and the other connects — rejected, the host
sequences the game and is therefore a de-facto referee. (b) A shared message
broker — rejected, it is a central component by another name.
**Trade-off** Twice the moving parts per process, and the symmetric loop needs
care to avoid deadlock. Both peers push and wait concurrently, which is exercised
directly in `tests/integration/test_networked_sub_game.py` via `asyncio.gather`.

### ADR-002 · SHA-256 commit-reveal with nonces withheld until the end

**Status** Accepted.
**Context** With no referee, a peer could choose its move after seeing the
opponent's.
**Decision** Seal `SHA-256(canonical_json(payload) ‖ nonce)` before acting;
disclose payload at reveal and nonce only at the end of the sub-game (rule 18).
**Alternatives** (a) Reveal the nonce each step — rejected, it leaks the
commitment structure earlier than needed for no gain. (b) Digital signatures —
rejected, they authenticate the *author*, not the *timing*, which is the
property at issue here.
**Trade-off** Verification is deferred to the end. Accepted: the whole log is
checked at once, and a mismatch is a technical loss either way.

### ADR-003 · The LLM never decides a move

**Status** Accepted (rule 25).
**Context** A language model could plausibly pick moves.
**Decision** Movement is deterministic Python. The LLM composes only the
one-sentence hint.
**Alternatives** LLM-chosen moves — rejected: hallucinated illegal moves are a
technical loss, latency threatens the 30 s deadline, and a replayed log stops
being explicable.
**Trade-off** The rhetorical layer is decorative unless the *receiving* side
decodes it — which is why ADR-007 exists.

### ADR-004 · Belief transport, not re-weighting, for a directional claim

**Status** Accepted (supersedes the original design).
**Context** A hint claims a heading. The first implementation built the set of
cells "consistent with north" and boosted them.
**Decision** Transport a fraction `trust` of every cell's mass one step in the
claimed direction; leave `1 − trust` in place.
**Rationale** Once belief has diffused, almost every cell has a northern
neighbour, so the claimed set covered the board and the re-weighting cancelled
out — a mechanism that provably did nothing. A directional claim is evidence
about how the cloud *moved*, and transport is the update it licenses.
**Trade-off** Mass at a wall cannot move and stays put, which slightly biases
belief toward edges. Accepted: the alternative is belief evaporating off-board.

### ADR-005 · Cross-examine the sentence, not the revealed move

**Status** Accepted (bug fix, commit `96229b2`).
**Context** Lie detection scored the opponent's revealed move.
**Decision** Decode and score the *hint*.
**Rationale** The move is sealed in the commitment and is therefore always
truthful; cross-examining it could only ever confirm honesty. Measured: trust sat
pinned at its 0.9 ceiling in every match and a compulsive liar was
indistinguishable from an honest opponent.
**Result** Liar collapses to the 0.020 floor with 97% of its claims contradicted;
honest opponent settles at 0.724. Measured over 30 seeds — `results/trust.json`.

### ADR-006 · Read the opponent's heading from scent-centroid drift

**Status** Accepted.
**Context** A claim needs something physical to be checked against.
**Decision** Compare the sub-cell centroid of the opponent's trail between
samples; the dominant axis of the drift is the observed heading.
**Alternatives measured, not assumed** — (a) Half-plane scent mass relative to
the trail peak: agreed with the true heading on roughly half of turns, and was
outvoted by the wrong direction on several. (b) Peak-cell displacement: the peak
moves in integer jumps, so it reads as "no movement" then "impossible movement".
(c) Centroid drift: agreed on ~80% of turns where the opponent actually moved
(69.3% of all claims once stationary turns are counted too).
**Trade-off** Measured over 30 seeds, a perfectly honest opponent still has
30.7% of its claims contradicted, so trust settles at 0.724 rather than at the
0.90 ceiling. That is honest about the measurement's noise, and the separation
from a liar (0.020, with 97% of claims contradicted) is still decisive.

### ADR-007 · Deception is rationed, not sprayed

**Status** Accepted.
**Context** How often should the thief lie?
**Decision** Lie only when the believed cop position is within `bluff_range`, and
then only every `bluff_period` turns.
**Rationale** The opponent runs the same cross-check we do. A thief that lies
every turn trains the cop to ignore it, and a hint nobody believes is worth
nothing when one is finally needed. Confirmed by the trust measurements: the
compulsive liar earns 0.020 trust, the rationed liar 0.679, against 0.724 for a
thief that never lies at all. The sweep adds the other half of the argument:
lying every turn raises the thief's own chance of being captured from 0.133 to
0.333, so over-lying is not merely wasteful, it is actively losing.

### ADR-008 · The Gatekeeper queues rather than rejects

**Status** Accepted (revised).
**Context** An autonomous agent that e-mails in a loop gets the account
suspended.
**Decision** `DosDetector → QuotaManager → TokenBucket → OverflowQueue`. Excess
work waits with backpressure.
**Alternatives** Rejecting over-limit calls — rejected: the caller then either
drops the report (data loss) or retries in a hot loop (the original problem).
**Trade-off** A caller can block. Bounded by queue depth, and a full queue raises
`QueueFullError` rather than growing without limit.

### ADR-009 · The revealed move does not collapse belief

**Status** Accepted, with a noted tension in the source material.
**Context** The protocol discloses the move each step (booklet §5.3.2), and start
positions are agreed. Applying revealed directions to a known start would make
the opponent's position exactly known, and the belief map pointless.
**Decision** `apply_opponent_move` advances the diffusion model and records
barriers; it does not shift belief by the revealed direction.
**Rationale** Booklet §6.4 is explicit that neither side sees the other's true
position and that the belief map is `P(opponent = s | hints)`. Where the two
readings conflict, the chapter defining the mechanism governs. A move name only
locates someone if you already knew where they were.
**Trade-off** We discard information the wire technically carries. Accepted: the
alternative deletes the graded mechanism.

### ADR-010 · JSON over TOML for configuration

**Status** Accepted.
**Context** Rule 11 requires both peers to hold a byte-identical agreed config
and to hash it.
**Decision** JSON, hashed via canonical serialisation.
**Rationale** JSON has one canonical form across languages; TOML does not, so two
peers writing "the same" config could hash differently and refuse to play.

### ADR-011 · Two clocks, one measuring progress

**Status** Accepted.
**Context** Rule 6 makes an unfinished sub-game a technical loss for *both*
teams.
**Decision** `TurnDeadline` (30 s, per message) and `Watchdog` (60 s, fed only by
`beat()` at the end of a completed step).
**Rationale** A single per-message timeout cannot catch an opponent that answers
every message promptly while never advancing the game. The watchdog measures
progress, so livelock trips it.

### ADR-012 · `barrier_engage_range` set to 1, chosen by max-min over five thieves

**Status** Accepted. Supersedes the hand-picked default of 4.
**Context** The cop may drop a barrier instead of moving. The original value of 4
was reasoned about, not measured: engage early, herd the thief. A one-at-a-time
sweep (`tools/sweep.py`, 2400 sub-games, raw data in `results/sweep.json`)
measured the opposite.

| `barrier_engage_range` | Capture rate ± SE |
|---|---|
| 1 | **0.850 ± 0.046** |
| 2 | 0.783 ± 0.053 |
| 4 | 0.133 ± 0.044 |

**Decision** Set it to 1.
**Rationale** A barrier costs the cop its move for that turn. Engaging from four
cells away means standing still while the thief walks away — the cop pays the
turn and buys nothing, because the thief is nowhere near the wall. At range 1 the
barrier is placed where the thief must actually cross it.

**Why max-min, not the sweep mean.** A sweep tunes against *one* opponent, so its
winner is a candidate, not a conclusion. The value was re-measured
(`tools/robustness.py`, `results/robustness.json`) against five structurally
different thieves — shipped, area-obsessed, distance-only, always-endgame,
never-bluffs — at 60 seeds each, and selected on the **worst** case rather than
the average:

| Level | Mean over thieves | Worst case |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | 0.737 | **0.433** |
| 2 | 0.740 | 0.367 |
| 4 | 0.120 | 0.050 |

Level 2 has a marginally better mean and a clearly worse floor. In a league where
the opponent is unknown and unrepeatable, the floor is the number that matters.

**Alternatives rejected** Keeping 4 as a "principled" default (it loses 6 games
in 7); picking by sweep mean alone (overfits to our own thief); making it
adaptive by observed opponent style (no sample size within a 35-step sub-game to
estimate the style before the decision must be made).

**Honest caveat** All five test thieves are ours, so they share our idea of what
a thief does. The measurement bounds overfitting to a single policy; it cannot
rule out overfitting to a single *authorship*. `barrier_engage_range` is TUNABLE
under Appendix F and can be changed between matches without touching code.

### ADR-013 · Capture is claimed and answered, not computed

**Status** Accepted. Closes a defect found while writing [COMPLIANCE.md](COMPLIANCE.md).
**Context** The local harness ends a sub-game by comparing both positions --
something it can do because it holds both. No peer can. The networked runner
checked only `survival_reached()`, so a cop standing on the thief in a real
league match would have played on to the move ceiling and scored the sub-game
as the thief's survival. Every test passed, because every test that could see
it was a local one.
**Decision** The cop attaches a `capture_claim` to every reveal, naming the cell
it is about to occupy -- or the cell it just sealed a barrier on (rule 46). The
thief answers truthfully from its own cell in the same round trip. Either
answer ends the sub-game.
**Rationale** The cop can only speak honestly about its own position, which is
the one thing it actually knows; the thief is the only party that can check the
claim. Both the claim and the answer are sealed in the commit chain, so a false
denial is provable at the audit and forfeits the game (rule 22) -- the mechanism
is honest because lying is strictly worse, not because we trust anyone.
**Alternatives rejected** Deriving the opponent's position from revealed moves
and the agreed start (contradicts ADR-009 and deletes the belief map);
exchanging positions every turn (hands the thief the pursuer's location for
free); detecting capture only at the final audit (the sub-game would run past
its own ending).
**Trade-off** The thief learns where the cop is, every turn. That is the
asymmetry the booklet intends: the pursued may see the pursuer, and the claim
is what makes rules 21 and 22 mean anything.

### ADR-014 · The coordinate ban is enforced on the way out, not requested

**Status** Accepted.
**Context** Rule 27 forbids a numeric position protocol; rule 26 requires free
natural language. The system prompt asked the model for both. A prompt is a
request, and a request is not a guarantee: a model returning "heading to 3,4"
would breach a rule whose sanction is losing the game's character.
**Decision** `strip_positions` deletes digit-bearing tokens and square-naming
vocabulary from every hint, for every provider including our own template bank,
immediately before `clamp_words`.
**Rationale** A guard that trusts some of its inputs is a guard that stops being
run. Deleting is preferred to refusing because a hint is optional: degrading to
a shorter sentence costs nothing, while raising here would turn a chatty model
into a technical loss.
**Trade-off** A legitimate sentence containing a number ("three steps behind
you") loses a word. Acceptable -- the taunt is not scored and the rule is.

---

### ADR-015 · One process is the whole peer: it serves and plays together

**Status** Accepted. Supersedes the two-terminal `serve` + `play` flow.
**Context** The README told an operator to run `serve` in one terminal and
`play` in another. Two processes, two `PeerSession` objects, no shared memory
between them -- so the opponent's commitments arrived in the *server's* session
while the turn loop waited on the *client's*. The first rehearsal over real
sockets sat at step 1 until the 30-second deadline and booked a technical loss
for both teams. Every test passed, because a `LoopbackClient` hands the runner
and the handlers the same session by construction.
**Decision** `play` starts the FastMCP server itself, in the same event loop and
over the same session, and waits (bounded) for the opponent's endpoint to answer
before move one. `serve` survives as the server half alone, for reachability
checks.
**Rationale** Rule 1 separates the *cop and the thief*, not a team's own halves;
one process per team is two per match. One event loop rather than a thread each
makes the interleaving of inbound handler and outbound loop cooperative, so the
order is the protocol's rather than the scheduler's.
**Trade-off** The peer no longer starts before it has somewhere to play. The
bounded wait covers the real case -- two teams never press enter together.

### ADR-016 · A tool signature is a wire contract, and is tested as one

**Status** Accepted.
**Context** FastMCP builds each tool's schema from its Python signature and
refuses any argument the signature does not name. `commit_step`, `reveal_step`
and `final_reveal` all omitted keys that `contracts.py` had been putting on the
wire for weeks -- including `capture_claim`, the whole of rule 21. Over a
loopback client the payload dict is passed straight through, so the suite was
structurally incapable of noticing. A real match would have been refused at
move one.
**Decision** Every key a payload builder emits appears in the corresponding tool
signature, including ones the handler ignores. `tests/integration/
test_live_transport.py` calls the real FastMCP tool layer with the real payload
builders and pins the refusal behaviour so the gap cannot reopen.
**Rationale** Being permissive about what we accept is also the right posture
towards an opponent's independent implementation; being strict about what we
send is not something we can check by reading.
**Trade-off** Signatures carry fields that look like noise. The docstring says
why, and the alternative is a technical loss nobody can debug during a match.

### ADR-017 · A peer that stops first declares how the sub-game ended

**Status** Accepted.
**Context** Rule 47 captures a thief with no legal move -- and only the thief
can see that. It stopped playing and exited; the cop, having won, waited out its
deadline for a commitment that was never coming and recorded a technical loss.
Rule 6 charges *both* teams for that.
**Decision** `final_reveal` carries an `outcome`. Receiving it marks the sub-game
finished on our side too, and a peer waiting for a message stops waiting and
adopts the declared ending instead of aborting. A fault raised after that
announcement is likewise treated as the expected consequence of an opponent that
has already gone.
**Rationale** The only ending a peer can declare unilaterally is one against
itself, and the disclosed chain arrives in the same message, so the claim is
checkable move by move rather than taken on trust.
**Trade-off** One more field to agree with an opponent. It defaults to empty and
an opponent that never sets it behaves exactly as before.

### ADR-018 · The agreement digest covers only what both teams can derive

**Status** Accepted.
**Context** `mutual_agreement.sha256` hashed the whole result summary --
including `started_at` (microseconds apart), `tokens` and `github_commit` (each
team's own), `audit` (a statement *about* the other side) and `game_uid` (minted
locally, never negotiated). Two rehearsal peers that agreed on every fact of the
match produced different digests. Rule 35 answers a contradiction by voiding the
match and scoring both teams zero.
**Decision** `agreed_summary` narrows the digest to the facts both peers derive
from the same protocol messages: game id, groups, and per sub-game the roles,
result, winner, tie flag and score, plus the series totals that follow from
them. Everything private is still *reported*, just not hashed.
**Rationale** A certificate of agreement may only cover things that can be
agreed. Hashing private fields does not make the report stricter, it makes it
meaningless -- it would have failed on every honest match and never once on a
dishonest one.
**Trade-off** Two teams that disagree only about a timestamp now hash the same.
That is the intended reading of rule 35: the ending is the thing.

---

### ADR-019 · We speak the opponent's tool surface, they do not speak ours

**Status** Accepted.
**Context** gal-roy1 publish six tools (`hello`, `propose_config`,
`declare_step0`, `submit_turn`, `final_audit`, `agree_result`), each taking a
single `payload` object. Ours name every field in the signature. Three names
collide with different calling conventions; three do not exist on our side at
all. Two teams that agree on every rule in the book still lose at move one
(rule 6).
**Decision** `mcp/interop.py` adapts their vocabulary to ours, and
`mcp/interop_server.py` binds the three non-colliding names. For the three that
collide, one endpoint answers both dialects by widening the signature —
`agree_result(sha256="", expected="", payload=None)` — rather than by
registering a second tool.
**Rationale** Their shape matches the lecturer's reference server, so it is what
a third team is likeliest to speak too; they dial out and drive, which makes our
side mostly a matter of answering correctly; and `PeerHandlers` already took a
single dict per call, so the whole mismatch lived in the server binding.
**Trade-off** We carry the translation cost for both teams. Cheaper than a
technical loss, and it means our native surface never has to change.
**Note** The adapter was written, unit-tested and *never bound to the server*.
Every test passed because they called the adapter directly. See ADR-016 — the
same lesson, learned twice.

---

### ADR-020 · `propose_config` answers a proposal; two digests, separately named

**Status** Accepted.
**Context** Their preflight sends `{"config": {...}}`. We read it as our own
older `{"handshake": {...}}` shape, found every field absent, and reported three
mismatches against empty strings — refusing a peer who had proposed a perfectly
legal config. Underneath sat a second fault: our published `config_sha256`
covers `AGREED_SECTIONS`, a *subset*; theirs covers the whole file. Those two
can never be equal, and their inequality says nothing about either config.
**Decision** Branch on the shape of what arrived. For a proposal, hash their
object under our encoding and return `config_sha256` (their object, our
canonicaliser), `our_config_sha256` (our whole config), and
`our_agreed_terms_sha256` (the subset) — each under its own name, plus
`illegal_terms` and a recursive `differing_terms`.
**Rationale** A matching digest proves the two *canonicalisations* agree, which
is the thing most likely to break (their CONNECT.md §3, and HW6). It does not
prove their defaults equal ours; conflating the two made rule 11 unsatisfiable
rather than satisfied. Two questions, two fields.
**Trade-off** Three digests in one reply is more surface to explain. Every one
of them answers a different question, and the failure we shipped was caused by
having one field answer two.

### ADR-021 · The mid-game reveal discloses the hint, the barrier, and nothing else

**Status** Accepted. Agreed with gal-roy1 as interop item I-5.
**Context** The reveal disclosed the entire sealed payload. Three fields should
never have been in it. `move` gives our heading away. `intent` is the truth/lie
flag, which annotates each sentence with whether to believe it — the deception
layer, handed over for free. Worst is `state`:
`SHA256({step, role, position, board})`, where every field but `position` is
public, leaving 49 candidates on a 7×7 board. We brute-forced our own disclosed
digest and recovered the exact cell in 49 hashes, every step, for both roles.
The binding that stops a commitment being replayed in another context
(book ch5.3.1) was also a plaintext position broadcast.
**Decision** `CommitRecord.revealed_view()` emits `MID_GAME_FIELDS` only —
`step`, `role`, `sub_game`, `hint`, `barrier`. The full payload is disclosed at
the final audit, where the nonce makes it verifiable and the match is decided.
We stopped *sending* `move` and `intent`; we still *accept* both, since a peer
who has not made this change will keep sending them.
**Rationale** The nonce is withheld until the audit (rule 18), so nothing
disclosed mid-game can be checked when it arrives. The mid-game reveal buys no
integrity whatsoever; it only gives information away. Barriers stay because
rule 15 requires the cop to declare each placement openly — common knowledge by
design, not a leak.
**Trade-off** None measurable. `apply_opponent_move` never read `move` — it only
ever consumed the barrier and counted the step — so we were disclosing ours
every turn and discarding theirs unread.
**Consequence** The capture claim is now the only position we disclose in the
clear, and a cop that claims on every step broadcasts its exact track. That was
free while the move sat beside it; it is a real disclosure now. Raised with
gal-roy1 rather than changed unilaterally, because it alters when messages
appear on the wire.
**Note** All 461 in-process tests passed with the mandatory `move: str` still in
the `reveal_step` signature; two real peers could not complete one step. Caught
by the rehearsal gate, which is the third time a tool signature has been the
wire contract (ADR-016, ADR-019).

### ADR-022 · The transmitted scent field is lagged one full turn

**Status** Accepted. Agreed with gal-roy1 as interop item I-6; it is their
default and our reading of book ch4.
**Context** `sample_scent` answered from `my_scent`, the live field, which has
already absorbed the current turn's emission. A sampled field therefore carried
a full-strength kernel centred on the emitter, so the opponent's exact cell was
readable directly. Every layer above it became decoration: the belief map had
nothing to infer, the hints nothing to corroborate, the deception layer nothing
to hide. A cop could simply climb the gradient.
**Decision** A `LaggedTrail` delay line snapshots the field *before* each turn's
emission and serves that. `pheromone_transmit_lag` (default 1) carries the depth
in the agreed config, inside an `AGREED_SECTION`, so it is frozen by
`config_sha256` — two peers running different lags would each be reading a field
the other believes it is not sending. It is deliberately **not** an Appendix F
term: it is a negotiated reading, not a permanent constant.
**Rationale** Lagged, the trail is evidence; live, it is the answer.
**Trade-off** Real, and much smaller than first reported. **The figures
originally recorded here were wrong and are corrected below** — see ADR-025 for
the measurement fault that produced them. Measured against the configuration we
actually deploy, over 80 seeds against a five-thief panel, the cop's worst-case
capture rate under the agreed lag is **0.90**, and 1.00 against our own shipped
thief. The lag makes the game harder to read; it does not disable the cop.

**Consequence — the notebook figures describe a game we no longer play.**
Every sweep, sensitivity run and figure was measured on the local harness, which
sampled the live field. `local_match.transmitted_field` now routes the harness
through the same delay line, so the numbers must be regenerated before they are
submitted as evidence of anything.

**Retracted:** an earlier version of this ADR reasoned from a 0.033 capture rate
to "every series ends 45–45 and the league is 2-point draws". The premise was a
measurement artefact. The arithmetic was right and the input was not, which is
the more embarrassing of the two.

**Resolved, and the diagnosis recorded here was wrong.** An earlier version of
this paragraph reported the three paths disagreeing — 1.000 locally, 0/10 over
the interop turn loop, survival in every two-process rehearsal — and blamed
*when* the two positions are compared. It also warned that this limited every
number in `results/`. Both claims are withdrawn. See ADR-026 for the actual
cause; the harness numbers were never in question, and all three paths now agree.

### ADR-023 · Alternating turns are reconciled at the round, not at the message

**Status** Accepted. Agreed with gal-roy1 as interop item I-7.
**Context** Their protocol is alternating with a turn token: receiving a
`TurnMessage` makes it your move. Ours is simultaneous — both commit, both
reveal, both apply. `submit_turn` refused for weeks rather than guess, because a
translator built on a guess passes its own tests and desynchronises a real match.
**Decision** `runtime/turn_loop.py` drives one *side* of a round at a time:
absorb what arrived, then act. A round means the same thing in both protocols —
one action from each side, then the trails decay — so that is where the two
models meet. The engine underneath is untouched; `PeerSession` still holds the
board, the posterior and the commit chain, and the same audit runs over the same
records (rule 36). Our reply rides home in `reply_turn`, so they can drive the
whole match over outbound connections only and neither peer needs to be dialable.
**Rationale** Reconciling at the message would have meant a second engine.
Reconciling at the round is a ~120-line adapter.
**Trade-off** Mid-round the two peers are one action apart by construction. That
is correct and had to be written into the tests as an invariant, because the
obvious assertion — equality — is an assertion that the protocol is simultaneous.

**The bug this shape invites.** The first version echoed the sender's step back.
That pins both peers on step 1 forever: every commitment recorded under one key,
each overwriting the last, and an audit reporting five forgeries at step 1
because five payloads were announced under one commitment. The fix is that the
reply step depends on whether *we* have already acted in that round —
`theirs if self.round < theirs else theirs + 1`.

**The gap it exposed in our own auditor.** Whoever moves last always has a turn
in flight, so the disclosed chain legitimately contains one step the other side
never received a commitment for. We already failed the mirror case
(`withheld_steps`); we silently *accepted* this one — meaning a peer could append
fabricated steps at audit time, written after the outcome was known, bound by
nothing. Now reported as `unsolicited_steps`, and the rule is positional rather
than absolute: a disclosure past the last seal we hold is an in-flight turn and
is fine; a disclosure in a *gap* below it is a step that was never played and
fails. Failing all of them would fail every honest alternating match on its final
step, which is the same mistake as ADR-021's, from the other side.

### ADR-025 · A baseline measures the config on disk, not the class defaults

**Status** Accepted. Written after the fault below reached an opponent.
**Context** `tools/sweep.py` measured its baseline with
`one_match(shared, {}, {}, seed)` and labelled the row "the shipped defaults".
An empty strategy dict makes every brain fall back to its **class** defaults,
and those are not what we ship: `CopBrain.BARRIER_ENGAGE_RANGE` is 4, and
`config/police/setup.json` sets it to 1. Under the agreed scent lag that single
key is the difference between a cop that captures 0.03 of the time and one that
captures 0.90 — because a barrier costs a *turn*, so engaging from four cells
away leaves the cop standing still while the thief walks off, and the shipped
cop spends 13.9 of its 14 barriers doing exactly that.

`sweep_one` had the same fault from the other side: it overrode one key on top
of `{}`, so every swept level was measured against an opponent we do not run.

**What it cost.** The bad baseline was reported to gal-roy1 twice as our
measured capture rate, and ADR-022 reasoned from it to a confident and wrong
conclusion about the whole league. They replied with their own 0.333 and the
mechanism behind it, and the 10× gap was read as a strategy deficit on our side.
There was no deficit. There was a baseline measuring a configuration nobody runs.

**Decision** `shipped_strategy(role)` reads the strategy block from the config
on disk, and both the baseline and every swept level start from it.
**Rationale** A baseline that does not describe the thing being shipped is worse
than no baseline: it is confidently wrong in whichever direction the untested
defaults happen to point, and every comparison drawn against it inherits that.
**Trade-off** The sweep now depends on files rather than being self-contained.
Worth it — self-contained was precisely the property that let it measure fiction.
**Lesson, stated plainly because it is the recurring one in this project.** Every
verification habit here was aimed at the *opponent's* claims. This number was
ours, so nothing checked it. The rule that would have caught it is the same one
that caught their mislabelled Vector B: a test vector needs its own assertion,
and so does a baseline.

### ADR-026 · A barrier is declared from the decision, never from the sealed view

**Status** Accepted. This is the fix for the three-way disagreement ADR-022
originally blamed on capture-comparison semantics.
**Context** `PeerRunner._push_reveal` built its declaration out of
`session.reveal()["payload"]` — the sealed payload narrowed to `MID_GAME_FIELDS`
(ADR-021). That worked while the payload had a `barrier` key. When we adopted
gal-roy1's `StepIntent` shape (ADR-020) it stopped having one: a placement is
encoded inside the sealed `move` as `BARRIER:r,c`. The filter matched nothing,
`.get("barrier")` returned `None`, and **the networked peer sent `barrier: null`
on every step of every game.**

**What it cost.** Rules 15 and 16 require every placement to be declared openly
and truthfully, so this was a compliance failure before it was a strategy one.
Worse, it desynchronised the two boards: our walls existed only for us. The
opponent walked through them, and rule 47 — a thief with no legal move counts as
captured — could never fire, because the thief's board had nothing in it. In the
rehearsal that produced a cop which correctly manoeuvred the thief into the (6,6)
corner, correctly walled both its exits at steps 15 and 16, and then sat still
for nineteen turns while the thief strolled out through a wall; the cop had also
sealed *itself* into (5,5) behind four barriers only it could see.

**Why nothing caught it.** Both commit chains verified. Both audits passed. Both
peers agreed on the outcome. 488 tests were green. The only symptom was a capture
rate of zero on one path — and the two paths that did work masked it, because the
local harness passes `decision.barrier` across directly and the interop turn loop
already declared from `pending_declaration`. Only the native protocol read from
the sealed view, and no test asserted that a declaration *arrived*.

**Decision** `_push_reveal` takes both the hint and the barrier from
`pending_declaration()`, the same source the interop loop uses.
`test_every_barrier_we_place_is_declared_and_reaches_the_opponents_board`
asserts the placement went out **and** that it landed on the opponent's board;
checking only the payload would pass on a peer declaring into a void.
**Rationale** An open declaration and a sealed commitment are different
obligations over the same fact. Deriving one from the other couples them, and
the coupling broke silently the moment the sealed shape changed.
**Trade-off** The barrier is now stated twice — sealed in `move`, declared in
`barrier`. That redundancy is the point: rule 15 makes it common knowledge, and
the audit makes the declaration checkable against the seal afterwards.
**Result** Local harness 1.000, interop turn loop 1.000, and the two-process
rehearsal now ends in `capture` at step 16 with both peers agreeing and both
audits clean. `MID_GAME_FIELDS` keeps its stale `sub_game`/`barrier` entries on
purpose — an allow-list should filter an older peer's shape, not leak it.
**Lesson.** ADR-025's was that we only verify the opponent's claims. This one is
narrower and sharper: we tested that our messages were *well formed*, never that
their content *changed the opponent's world*. A protocol test that never inspects
the receiver can only prove that nobody crashed.

### ADR-027 · Our step number is monotonic whatever the peer sends

**Status** Accepted. Reported by gal-roy1 twice (channel seq 35, 37) before we
could reproduce it; their report was correct and precise.
**Context** They observed our nil-opening reply and our round-1 reply both
arriving as **step 2, with different commitments**. Reproduced by sending two
handovers before any real turn:

| received | our reply | round |
|---|---|---|
| nil #1 | step 1 | 1 |
| nil #2 | step 2 | 2 |
| their step 1 | **step 2 again** | 2 |

Two defects, stacked. A repeated handover made us act again, because
`receive` answered every nil unconditionally — so we took two moves against an
opponent who had never moved, which is not a desync but a cheat. Then
`_reply_step`'s `theirs + 1` landed on a step we had **already sealed**, and two
payloads under two commitments at one step number is indistinguishable from a
forgery. Our own auditor would have flagged it, against us.

**Decision** Two independent guards, deliberately not one.
`_may_act()` refuses to act while `round > opponent_steps_seen` — a handover
does not raise that counter, which is exactly what makes a repeated nil visible.
It *declines* with an answer rather than raising, because an exception crosses
MCP as an opaque transport failure and rule 6 charges both teams for the stall.
Separately, `_reply_step` now floors at `self.round + 1`, so our step number is
monotonic no matter what arrives — a retry, a duplicate, or a driver that
numbers rounds differently.
**Rationale** The floor is defence in depth and the important half. The first
guard rests on my model of how a peer misbehaves; the floor holds even where
that model is wrong, and the audit is keyed on the step number (rules 19, 36).
**Trade-off** We can now decline a turn a peer believes is legal. That is the
right side to err on: a declined turn is visible and recoverable, a duplicated
step number is only discovered at the audit, when the match is over.
**Lesson.** This sat behind a passing suite because every test drove a *tidy*
sequence. The regression test drives `1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2` on purpose. An opponent
is not obliged to be tidy, and the protocol has to be right when they are not.

### ADR-028 · Roles across a series are derived, never named

**Status** Accepted. Agreed with gal-roy1 (channel seq 37 asked, seq 39
confirmed); `CONNECT.md` §6 had proposed 3-and-3 without pinning the form.
**Context** The rulebook never assigns roles across a series, and the scoring is
asymmetric — capture pays the cop 20, survival pays the thief 10 — so a pairing
where one team always played cop would be structurally unfair.

Our rule was `roles_for_sub_game(sub_game, group_a, group_b)`, swapping on the
parity of the sub-game number with the *locally named* team first. It reads as
3-and-3 and it is not a rule at all: it is a function of argument order. Each
peer calls it as `(us, them)`, so **each peer computes itself as the cop in
every odd sub-game** and the two sides disagree about all six.

Nothing caught it because only one side ever ran it. The local harness plays
both halves in one process, where a self-consistent wrong answer is
indistinguishable from a right one — the same shape as ADR-026, found the same
way, one layer up.

**Decision** The cop for the first half of the series is `sorted(group_ids)[0]`,
and the second half the other team. The halfway point is derived from the agreed
`num_sub_games` rather than hard-coded at 3, so it cannot drift from what both
peers fingerprinted. The rule lives in `p2pchase.domain.roles` — a rule, not a
service — because the MCP handlers and the CLI both have to reach it without
importing a series runner.

Three consequences follow, and the first two are the point:

* `declare_step0` **refuses** a peer whose declared role is not complementary,
  *and* refuses a complementary pair that has the series backwards. A check for
  one-of-each alone would wave through two internally-consistent peers playing
  the wrong halves.
* We now **send** a step-0 declaration naming our role, so they can refuse us
  too. A check that only ran inbound would leave the opponent blind.
* Omitting `--role` lets the rule pick the side, including which config to load.
  A `--role` that contradicts it is refused rather than silently corrected.

**Rationale** Sorting is what makes the assignment derivable rather than
negotiable: both peers compute the same answer from the two group ids and the
sub-game number alone, with no message to exchange. A role clash is not a bad
sub-game, it is an unplayable one — two cops chase nobody — and rule 6 charges
*both* teams for the stall.
**Trade-off** An odd series cannot be split evenly, and the extra sub-game falls
to the second-sorted team. That is arbitrary, but it is arbitrary *identically
on both sides*, which is the only property that matters. A peer that declares no
role is accepted, because we cannot check what nobody stated; the response says
`role_checked: false` rather than reading as a clean bill of health.
**Lesson.** An agreement between two peers that only one peer ever evaluates is
not an agreement, it is a local convention. The test that matters computes the
assignment from both sides and asserts they are complements — which the parity
rule fails on all six sub-games and passes zero times.

---

### ADR-029 · A 406 explains itself in our log

**Status** Accepted.
**Context** Our peer server exchanged tools cleanly with gal-roy1 for four
minutes at 20:55, went quiet, and from 00:10 was POSTed every thirty seconds
from two addresses — 96 requests, every one answered `406 Not Acceptable`
before any of our code ran. MCP's streamable-HTTP transport requires an
`Accept` header naming both `application/json` and `text/event-stream`, and
refuses the request in the SDK when it does not.

From our side an opponent being turned away at the door looks exactly like an
opponent who never knocked. That is a rule 6 technical loss for both teams,
arrived at without either side doing anything wrong.

**Decision** A pure-ASGI passthrough in front of the transport logs the
offending `Accept` header, what was missing, and the exact header a client must
send. It changes no behaviour.
**Rationale** Being lenient was the tempting option and is wrong: rewriting the
header would answer with an event stream to a client that has just said it
cannot read one, which fails later and quieter than an honest refusal. The SDK
does have a JSON-only response mode, but switching the live wire format
unilaterally to accommodate a client we cannot inspect would risk the path that
already works — so it stays available and unused, and they get told instead.
**Lesson.** This was only diagnosable because the server's output was going to a
file by then (the fix from the previous session). Logging made it findable; this
makes it findable *without* someone who happens to know what a 406 means here.

## 4. Interface contracts

### 4.1 MCP tools (eleven, symmetric)

| Tool | Direction | Payload | Response |
|---|---|---|---|
| `hello` | both | — | `{ok, handshake, tools}` |
| `negotiate` | both | `{handshake}` | `{ok, agreed, mismatches}` |
| `declare_step0` | both | signed declaration + `{group_id, role}` | `{ok, our_role, their_role, role_checked}`; refuses a role clash (ADR-028) |
| `commit_step` | both | `{game_id, sub_game_number, step, commit, sender_group, sender_role}` | `{ok}` |
| `acknowledge_step` | both | `{game_id, sub_game_number, step}` | `{ok, held}` |
| `reveal_step` | both | `{…, move, hint, barrier?, capture_claim?}` | `{ok, caught}` |
| `sample_scent` | both | `{…, cells: [[r,c],…]}` | `{ok, samples: {"r,c": φ}}` |
| `final_reveal` | both | `{game_id, sub_game_number, sender_group, records, outcome}` | `{ok, records, group}` |
| `audit_result` | both | `{records}` | `{ok, passed, failed_steps}` |
| `agree_result` | both | `{sha256, expected}` | `{ok, agreed}` |
| `abort` | both | `{reason}` | `{ok}` |

**Refusals are data, not exceptions.** Every handler answers
`{"ok": false, "reason": …}` rather than raising. An exception crossing MCP
reaches the opponent as an opaque transport failure indistinguishable from a
crash, and rule 6 charges both teams for a stall.

### 4.2 SDK surface

```python
sdk = P2PChaseSDK.for_role("police")
sdk.describe()                      # identity, fingerprints, hardware
sdk.handshake()                     # what an opponent must match
sdk.agree_with(theirs)              # -> Agreement
sdk.run_series(opponent, sub_games) # -> SeriesResult, writes all artifacts
sdk.verify_log(path)                # -> AuditVerdict
sdk.audit_opponent(paths)           # -> (all_passed, verdicts)   rule 36
sdk.replay_text(path)               # human-readable replay
sdk.send_report(result, dry_run)    # -> DeliveryReceipt, via the Gatekeeper
sdk.gate_status()                   # queue health
```

### 4.3 Configuration split

| File | Shared? | Contents |
|---|---|---|
| `config/<role>/game.json` | **Yes** — byte-identical, hashed (rule 11) | Agreed physics: board, movement, scoring, pheromones, timeouts |
| `config/<role>/setup.json` | No — private | Port, opponent URL, group identity, strategy weights, talk provider, LLM settings |
| `config/rate_limits.json` | No | Gatekeeper limits per service |

The decision test is one question: *must the opponent agree to this value, or
rely on it?* If yes it is shared; if no it stays private. Precedence is
one-directional — a private file can never weaken a signed term.

---

## 5. Data schemas

All four artifacts carry `_schema`, `schema_version`, `game_id` and `game_uid`.

### 5.1 Commit record (the unit of integrity)

```json
{
  "payload": {
    "step": 7, "role": "thief", "sub_game_number": 1,
    "move": "N", "hint": "Moving north past Harlem. Still breathing.",
    "intent": "truth", "barrier": null,
    "state_digest": "<sha256 of the board snapshot>"
  },
  "nonce": "<128-bit hex, disclosed only at final reveal>",
  "commit": "<sha256(canonical_json(payload) ‖ nonce)>"
}
```

`state_digest` binds the commitment to the board it was made on, so an old
commitment cannot be replayed in a new context.

### 5.2 Artifact set per game

| File | One per | Contains |
|---|---|---|
| `declaration_<game_id>.json` | game | Both identities, hardware, repos, MCP URLs, budget |
| `config_<game_id>_g<NN>.json` | sub-game | The agreed terms actually played, hashed |
| `log_<game_id>_g<NN>.json` | sub-game | Step 0 declaration + every commit record + audit verdict |
| `result_<game_id>.json` | game | Per-sub-game outcomes, tally, tokens, mutual agreement digest |
