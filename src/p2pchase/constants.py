"""Project-wide constants.

Every quantitative value in this project is owned by the binding parameter
table (book Appendix F) and reaches the code through ``config/game.json``.
The values mirrored here are DEFAULTS ONLY -- they are what the code falls
back to when the shared, agreed config does not specify a key, exactly as
Appendix F requires ("in the absence of an explicit agreement between the
parties, the code must ensure the example value is the default").

Nothing here may be lowered. Parameters marked PERMANENT in Appendix F must
not change at all; deviation disqualifies the team.
