"""FIFO overflow queue with backpressure (guidelines §5.3).

The rule this module exists to satisfy is specific: when a rate limit is
reached the Gatekeeper must *queue* the request, not reject it and not crash.
Rejecting looks safer and is worse -- the caller either loses the report or
retries immediately, which is precisely the runaway pattern the DOS detector
is there to catch.

So overflow waits its turn. Fairness is strict FIFO, because the alternative
(letting a late caller through while an earlier one waits) makes the delay
unbounded for whoever is unlucky. The queue is bounded: past ``max_depth`` the
system is genuinely overloaded and the honest answer is backpressure, signalled
to the caller rather than hidden behind an ever-growing buffer.

Thread safety matters here (guidelines §15.2): the peer runtime services the
network on one thread while the reporter may enqueue from another, so every
mutation is taken under a single re-entrant lock.
