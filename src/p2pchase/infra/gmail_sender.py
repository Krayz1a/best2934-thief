"""Gmail delivery with send-only scope (book rules 30, 33, 34).

Three constraints shape this module, and each one is a rule rather than a
preference.

*Send-only.* :data:`SCOPES` grants ``gmail.send`` and nothing else (rule 30).
The agent has no business reading a mailbox, and a compromised token that can
only send is a far smaller problem than one that can read.

*Attachment, never body text.* The result must travel as an attached JSON file;
a plaintext report is rejected and scores zero (rule 34). So the JSON is
attached as ``application/json`` and the body carries only a human summary.

*Credentials from the environment.* Paths come from environment variables and
the files themselves are git-ignored. Nothing in this module ever writes a
secret into a config file or a log line (rule 39).

The interactive consent flow is deliberately NOT run automatically -- see
:func:`authorize`. A human runs it once, in their own browser.
