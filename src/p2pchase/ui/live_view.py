"""The live view: watching one peer's belief evolve during a match.

Two renderers, one data source. Both consume ``OwnState.local_view()`` and
nothing else, which is how rules 8 and 9 are satisfied structurally rather than
by discipline -- there is no code path through which the objective board could
reach a renderer, because no renderer accepts it.

``tk``    a Tkinter canvas with the belief heat map. The screenshot the README
          requires (ch9.4.2) comes from here.
``text``  a terminal renderer, used when Tkinter is absent (it ships in the
          ``python3-tk`` system package on Debian and Ubuntu, not via pip) and
          whenever the run is headless, such as in CI.

The text mode is not a consolation prize. It makes the view usable over SSH and
testable in a unit test, neither of which a canvas manages.
