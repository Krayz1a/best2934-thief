"""The pre-game declaration and the locked sub-game config (book ch5, ch9.3.3).

These are the two artifacts written *before* play, and both exist to remove
arguments afterwards.

The **declaration** is the immutable spine of a whole series: who is playing,
from which repositories, on what hardware, with which model and token cap.
Roles swap between sub-games, so no role and no sub-game number appear here --
anything that varies per sub-game belongs in the log and the result.

The **config artifact** is one sub-game's agreed parameters, locked with
``config_sha256``. Both peers must hold a byte-identical copy (rule 11); the
pre-game exchange compares the digest and refuses to play on any mismatch. The
digest covers the agreed terms only, not the derived naming metadata, which is
identical on both sides by construction anyway.
