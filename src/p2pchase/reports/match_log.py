"""The per-sub-game disclosed log -- the input to the replay verifier (ch7.4).

A log is written once, at the end of a sub-game, and it is the only artifact
that contains nonces. That timing is the whole security argument: during play a
peer publishes commitments alone, so nothing about a move can be inferred from
its hash; after play the nonces are disclosed and every commitment becomes
independently checkable (rule 18).

``records`` are audit views -- payload, nonce and announced commitment for each
step, including the Step-0 hardware declaration, which is why ``steps`` counts
``len(records) - 1``.
