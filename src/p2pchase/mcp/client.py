"""MCP client: the half of a peer that calls the other peer.

Both agents run one of these alongside their server, which is what makes the
architecture genuinely peer-to-peer rather than client/server with extra steps.

Two behaviours here are load-bearing:

*Every call is deadline-bounded.* Rule 6 makes an unfinished sub-game a
technical loss for both teams, so a call that never returns is worse than a call
that fails. :class:`PeerClient` carries the agreed response timeout and applies
it to every request.

*A refusal is data, not an exception.* The handlers on the far side answer with
``{"ok": false, "reason": ...}``, and :meth:`PeerClient.call` returns that
verbatim. Only transport failures raise, so the orchestrator can tell "you sent
me something I cannot accept" apart from "you are not there".

The :class:`LoopbackClient` at the bottom talks to a handler object directly. It
exists so the protocol can be exercised end to end in tests without a socket --
never as a way to play a real match, which rules 1 and 2 forbid.
