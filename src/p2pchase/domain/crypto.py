"""Commit-Reveal over SHA-256 -- integrity without a judge.

Book chapter 5. There is no referee on this network, so trust is not assumed,
it is proved. Every step runs four mandatory phases in order:

  1. Commit          -- send ONLY ``H = SHA256(canonical_json(record))``.
  2. Acknowledge     -- the opponent confirms it is locked on that commitment.
  3. Reveal          -- send the move and the verbal hint. The nonce stays secret.
  4. Final Reveal    -- at the END of the match, all nonces are disclosed and
                        both sides re-hash every step (mutual audit).

Any mismatch between a recomputed hash and the hash announced at commit time
proves tampering. There is no room for interpretation and no statistical doubt:
SHA-256 is sensitive to a single bit. The forging team takes a technical loss --
score 0 -- regardless of what happened on the board (rules 17-19).

The nonce is what makes this safe. The move space is tiny (five moves), so
without a fresh random nonce per commitment an opponent could pre-hash every
possibility and crack the commitment instantly (dictionary attack). It is kept
absolutely secret until the final audit (rule 18).
