"""One peer's LOCAL truth -- the only world state it is entitled to hold.

Book chapter 2 and rules 8/9. A peer knows, with certainty:
  * where it itself stands,
  * every barrier declared openly on the network (the cop must declare each
    placement truthfully, rule 15/16, so barriers are common knowledge),
  * its own emitted scent field and the opponent's sampled field,
  * whatever the opponent has revealed through the protocol.

It does NOT know where the opponent actually is. That is a *belief*, and the
separation is enforced here structurally: there is no attribute on this class
holding the opponent's true cell. Rendering or reasoning over an objective full
board view would be an illegal information advantage and disqualifies the
project.
