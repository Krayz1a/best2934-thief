"""Bayesian belief over the opponent's position under partial observation.

Book chapters 1, 4 and 6. Neither agent ever sees the true world state, so each
maintains a probability distribution over where the opponent might be and
updates it from two very different kinds of evidence:

  * The **scent map** -- physical, emitted by the mere act of moving, and
    impossible to forge. Strong evidence.
  * The **verbal hint** -- cheap talk, explicitly allowed to be a lie, and
    committed with a truth/lie ``intent`` flag the opponent only discloses at
    the final audit. Weak evidence, and its weight is *learned*.

The trust coefficient is the interesting part. Every turn we compare what the
hint claimed against what the scent actually showed. An opponent whose words
keep contradicting its trail earns a collapsing trust weight, and its future
hints stop moving our belief at all -- the book's "lie detection" worked
example, generalised into a running estimator rather than a one-off check.

This map is what the live GUI renders as a heat map (book ch7). It shows only
LOCAL truth: our own position plus our belief about the opponent. Rendering the
true objective board would be an illegal information advantage (rules 8, 9).
