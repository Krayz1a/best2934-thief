"""The evader (book ch6). Survival, not distance, is the objective.

Naively maximising distance from the cop is a trap: it walks the thief into
corners, which is exactly what the cop's barriers are designed to exploit. The
dominant term here is therefore **reachable area** -- how much of the board the
thief can still get to. Distance matters, but as a safety margin rather than a
goal.

The thief must survive a fixed number of steps, so late in a sub-game it grows
willing to trade room for immediate safety: with two steps left, not being
adjacent to the cop is the only thing that counts.

Deception is handled here too, and deliberately rationed -- see
:meth:`ThiefBrain._choose_intent`.
