"""Dynamic pheromone trails -- stigmergy as an indirect coordination channel.

Book chapter 4. Every agent, cop and thief alike, emits a scent field of side
``pheromone_grid_size`` (5x5) centred on the cell it occupies, with intensity
``pheromone_center_intensity`` (0.9) at the centre falling off radially. After
every FULL turn (cop and thief have both moved) the whole board decays:

    tau_ij(t+1) = max(0, (1 - rho) * tau_ij(t) + delta_tau_ij)

with rho = ``pheromone_decay`` (0.10). All three parameters are PERMANENT in
Appendix F: deviation voids the match.

The scent cannot lie. It is emitted by the mere act of moving or standing and
cannot be forged or planted -- which is precisely what makes it the yardstick
against which an opponent's *verbal* hint is measured (book ch4, "lie
detection"). Each peer reads only its OPPONENT's field.

The emission kernel itself is NOT a binding parameter -- only the centre
intensity, the decay rate and the field size are. The book therefore requires
both teams to exchange the full emission-and-decay model, including a concrete
numeric example, and lock it cryptographically before the series starts. That
is what :func:`kernel_fingerprint` is for.
